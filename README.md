# OptProMP_frankaHW

This repo provides a planning interface to the real Franka Emika robot hardware.

It tests the performance of an optimized ProMP trajectory given surrounding static and dynamic obstacles.

Dynamic obtsacles are considered pushable. Hence the pushing cost term in the optimization problem.
